# roadmapFE
I am a UXR and a UED; I now take upon execution of my designs by getting a better understanding of how the layout works on the frontend
This is my portfolio(?)[of sorts] into the Frontend of things aside from my pursuit in designing screens and meeting user expectations

1. Single Page CV: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
  I used table to ensure margins were appropriate in the first attempt
  In the second iteration, after the inclusion of the div class, I did away with the table and added border settings to more closely match the reference file

  Takeaways: metadata, favicon, <i class="...">, style

3. WEB Portfolio-HTML: https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website
   This was a rollercoaster. I used tables to format a lot of data not touching upon div classes for formatting yet
   But the contact page was quite an endeavour. Using the input fields was fun but rather tricky to manipulate. Hence the contact page doesn't use table formatting
   The top nav bar is "responsive" thanks to the tables properties. Used <th> and <td> to give the impression of active tabs vs inactive ones
   
   Takeways: input, label, form, div
