# roadmapFE
I am a UXR and a UED; I now take upon execution of my designs by getting a better understanding of how the layout works on the frontend
This is my portfolio(?)[of sorts] into the Frontend of things aside from my pursuit in designing screens and meeting user expectations

1. Single Page CV: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
  I used table to ensure margins were appropriate in the first attempt
  In the second iteration, after the inclusion of the div class, I did away with the table and added border settings to more closely match the reference file
  Takeaways: metadata, favicon, <i class="...">, style
